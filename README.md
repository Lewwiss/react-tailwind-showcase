# React / Tailwind Showcase

This is a very simple example website to showcase my CSS and design skills.

## Setup

Details can be generated in the shopify admin dashboard, under private apps

## Installed Packages

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)
* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## Getting started

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app), so scripts use craco instead of react-scripts.

1. Install's all app dependencies.
```sh
  npm install
```

2. Runs the app locally in development mode.
```sh
  npm run start
```

3. Create's a production ready version of the app.
```sh
  npm run build
```
